# Excel-Projects
Here we have a dataset showing the informations of customers including their Marital Status, Gender , Income ,Children, Education, Occupation, Home Owner, Cars,	Commute Distance,	Region,	Age, and at the end it clarifies whether the customers have bought the bike or not.
Based on these data we can extract useful insights around which factors lead the customers to buy a bike or with which characteristics they are mostly potential to avoid bikes.
## Data Cleaning
the first step for us is to clean the data set including: removing duplicates, replace m with married s with single in marital satate and replace f with female and m with male in gender so it will increase the readability. a renge has been dedicated for different ages so it will decrease the variaty of data in this case.
